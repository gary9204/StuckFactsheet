"""
factsheet.types_abstract - defines Factsheet classes for abstract data
types.

Application Factsheet is based on a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design.
The initial implementation is based on GTK, which is a MVC-based
interface framework.  Factsheet uses GTK classes for model storage in
order to take advantage of GTK mechanisms.  This package defines
abstract classes and abstract factories to mitigate coupling between the
model and the view.
