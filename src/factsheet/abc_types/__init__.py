"""
Defines Factsheet classes and interfaces for abstract data types.

Package `abc_types` encapsulates model use of GTK classes and
mechanisms.  The intent is to minimize duplication with GTK but isolate
coupling at the same time.  The package contains subpackages for
factsheets (TBD), topics (TBD), facts (TBD) along with identification
information common to all three (:mod:`.abc_head`).  An additional
subpackage :mod:`.abc_factory` defines abstract factory methods for the
abstract classes.

See package :mod:`~factsheet.adapt_gtk` for implementation of
'abc_types' classes and interfaces.
