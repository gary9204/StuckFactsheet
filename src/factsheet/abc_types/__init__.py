"""
Defines Factsheet classes and interfaces for abstract data types.

Package ``abc_types`` encapsulates model use of user interface widget
toolkit classes and mechanisms as described in
:doc:`../guide/devel_notes`.  The package contains subpackages for
factsheets (:mod:`~factsheet.abc_types.abc_sheet`), topics
(:mod:`~factsheet.abc_types.abc_topic`), and facts (:mod:`.abc_fact`)
along with identification information common to all three
(:mod:`.abc_infoid`).  An additional subpackage :mod:`.abc_factory`
defines abstract factory methods for the abstract classes.

See package :mod:`~factsheet.adapt_gtk` for implementation of
``abc_types`` classes and interfaces with GTK.
