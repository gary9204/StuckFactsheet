Introduction
============

Factsheet is an application to investigate algebraic structures.
With Factsheet you can construct and explore small sets, operations,
and groups.  You can view the structures you construct in a variety of
formats and check their properties.

A Factsheet application document is called a *factsheet.*  A factsheet
consists of a hierarchy of *topics.*  Each topic includes a collection of
*facts* about the specific subject.  The set of integers module 6 is an
exmple of a topic.  The subset of divisors of zero is an example of a
fact.

Factsheet includes a collection of templates (called *specifications*),
which you can use to construct topics and facts.  For example, Factsheet
has a specification for contructing a group of integers module *n*.  You
choose the value of *n,* say 6, to construct the topic the group of
intergers modulo 6.

When you create a topic, all the topic's facts are undetermined.  You
select which facts you wish to check.  You also select how you want
Factsheet to present results of each check.
