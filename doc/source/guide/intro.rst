Introduction
============

Factsheet is an application to investigate algebraic structures.
Factsheet provides templates for constructing small sets, operations,
and groups. The templates include checks to produce facts about the
objects you construct.

A Factsheet application document is called a *factsheet.* A
factsheet contains a hierarchy of *topics.* Each topic is either a
template to constuct structures (such as sets of integers modulo
*n*) or a specified structure (such as the set of integers modulo
6). A topic for a specific structure contains a collection *facts*
about the structure. Initially facts are undetermined. A topic
includes a check for each fact to produce the value of the fact. For
example, each set topic has a size fact with a corresponding check to
calculate the set size.
